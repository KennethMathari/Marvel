# Fueled Coding Test
Oh no! One of Dr. Doom's nefarious hackers got into the codebase for our favorite Marvel character guide app! It seems they've made a mess of things. They removed the details screen, damaged some of the UI, and some other things. Perhaps you can help out and make it right!

## Assessment
Show us what you'd like to do to make the codebase functional and efficient again. There isn't necessarily an overarching right or wrong way to do things, we're mostly just interested to see what decisions you make along the way!

## Requirements
- You will need to connect to the live Marvel API to fetch data. You'll need credentials to be able to access the API, so you need to create a (free) account on the [Marvel Developer Portal](https://developer.marvel.com/) to get them. Once you get your public and private keys, update the constants in `ApiConstants.kt` with your keys and you should be good to go!
- If you use some AI help along the way, you must cite your query and leave a comment along with the solution code you used.
- Spend no more than 4-6 hours on this exercise. It's more about the quality of your work than the quantity!
- Add a detail screen to display details of a selected character
- Bonus points for adding tests for the business logic

## Completion
When you've finished, please include a short note with your response, explaining:
- What were your priorities, and why?
- If you had another two days, what would you have tackled next?
- What would you change about the structure of the code?
- What bugs did you find but not fix?
- What would you change about the visual design of the app?
- How long did you spend on this project(approximately)?

## Instructions
1. Clone this repo to a repo on your own Github account and **make it private**
2. Invite user `intakebot` to collaborate on that repo
3. Address each step of the problem above and commit as necessary
4. Once you are finished, open a PR on your work (in your own repository) and assign `intakebot` as the reviewer and notify your Fueled contact via email.
